## Technologies Used

While the repository README does not deeply enumerate the stack, based on standard practices and typical setups for such projects, the following technologies are likely involved:

### Frontend

- **Next.js** for development/build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** or other CSS utility frameworks for styling

### Backend

- **Node.js** for server-side JavaScript execution
- **Express.js** (commonly paired with Node.js for RESTful APIs)
- **judge0**: API for secure code running

### Other Significant Dependencies

- **npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun**: Supported package managers as shown in the startup instructions
- **CodeMirror**: Powerful browser-based code editors (common in such platforms)
- **Firebase**: For user management and secure code execution (if user auth is present)
- **Instance**: For hosting judge0
